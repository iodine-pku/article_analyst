# Introduction
This is a customized GPT using Openai's GPT-4 to analyze scientific news and scientific articles. The GPT is specially tuned to answer questions on summarizing the article, analyze inner logic of a piece of text, analyze role of a segment of text in whole article, and provide language points for English learners at senior undergrad level. You can also ask any questions about the text you have, e.g. "*How to understand this complex sentence*?" or "*What does this super-niche terminology mean?*". It will use baseline GPT-4 to answer these questions.

The configurations of this GPT can be found at `configuration.json`. The instructions for the GPT are at `instructions.txt`. The knowledge for the GPT is at `./knowledge/specifications.md`. The GPT is far from perfect and still needs active developing.
