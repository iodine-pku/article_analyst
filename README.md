# Introduction
This is a customized GPT using Openai's GPT-4 to analyze scientific news and scientific articles. The GPT is specially tuned to answer questions on summarizing the article, analyze inner logic of a piece of text, analyze role of a segment of text in whole article, and provide language points for English learners at senior undergrad level.

The configurations of this GPT can be found at `configuration.json`. The instructions for the GPT are at `instructions.txt`. The knowledge for the GPT is at `./knowledge/specifications.md`. The GPT is far from perfect and still needs active developing.
